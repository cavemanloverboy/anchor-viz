# Installation
Via cargo:
```bash
cargo install anchor-viz
```
then link the executable via e.g. either `cp /path/to/.cargo/bin/anchor-viz /usr/local/bin/anchorviz` or `ln -s /path/to/.cargo/bin/anchor-viz /usr/local/bin/anchorviz` if that's in your `PATH`.

From source:

To install, run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/anchorviz
cd anchorviz
make
```
to build the executable. On linux/mac, you can run 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/anchorviz
cd anchorviz
make linux-mac
```
to build the executable and then copy it to `/usr/local/bin/` to link the executable (assuming /usr/local/bin is in your `PATH`).

# Usage
To use anchorviz, run `anchorviz` in the root directory of an anchor project or in a program directory. For example,
```bash
anchor init my_project
cd my_project # or cd my_project/programs/my_project
anchorviz
```
Otherwise, specify the program name via `anchorviz -p my_program` while in the root of the anchor project.
