cargo install anchor-viz
```

From source:

To install, run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/anchor-viz
cd anchor-viz

```
to build the executable. On linux/mac, you can run 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cavemanloverboy/anchor-viz

# Usage
To use anchor-viz, run `anchor-viz` in the root directory of an anchor project or in a program directory. For example,
```bash
anchor init my_project
cd my_project # or cd my_project/programs/my_project
anchor-viz
```
Otherwise, specify the program name via `anchor-viz -p my_program` while in the root of the anchor project.
